    CurrentIdentifier is the most recent package source that was used to
    produce a revision. The package manager uses this field to determine
    whether to check for package updates for a given source when
    packagePullPolicy is set to IfNotPresent. Manually removing this field
    will cause the package manager to check that the current revision is
    correct for the given package source.
