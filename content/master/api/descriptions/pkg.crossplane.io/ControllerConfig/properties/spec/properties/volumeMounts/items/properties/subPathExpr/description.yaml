description: |-
    Expanded path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted.
    Behaves similarly to SubPath but environment variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment.
    Defaults to '' (volume's root).
    SubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive.
