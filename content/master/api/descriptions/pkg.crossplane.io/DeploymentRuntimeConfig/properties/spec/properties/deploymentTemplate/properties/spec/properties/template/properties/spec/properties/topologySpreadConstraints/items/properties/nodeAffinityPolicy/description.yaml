    NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
    when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:
    - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.
    - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.
    
    
    If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.
    This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
