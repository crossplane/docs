    EnvironmentConfigs selects a list of `EnvironmentConfig`s. The resolved
    resources are stored in the composite resource at
    `spec.environmentConfigRefs` and is only updated if it is null.
    
    
    The list of references is used to compute an in-memory environment at
    compose time. The data of all object is merged in the order they are
    listed, meaning the values of EnvironmentConfigs with a larger index take
    priority over ones with smaller indices.
    
    
    The computed environment can be accessed in a composition using
    `FromEnvironmentFieldPath` and `CombineFromEnvironment` patches.
