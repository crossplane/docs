This document has moved in recent versions of Crossplane documentation. 

Current Crossplane documentation versions introduce configurations as part of
the [Getting Started]({{<ref "/v1.11/getting-started" >}}) guides. 
{{</hint >}}

In order for Crossplane to be able to manage resources in a specific cloud
provider, you will need to create an account for Crossplane to use. Use the
links below for cloud-specific instructions to create an account that can be
used throughout the guides:

* [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Service Account]
* [Microsoft Azure Service Principal]
* [Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM User]

Once you have configured your cloud provider account, you can get started
provisioning resources!
