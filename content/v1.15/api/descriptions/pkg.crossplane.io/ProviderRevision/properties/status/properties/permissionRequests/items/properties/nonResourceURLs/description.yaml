    NonResourceURLs is a set of partial urls that a user should have access to.  *s are allowed, but only as the full, final step in the path
    Since non-resource URLs are not namespaced, this field is only applicable for ClusterRoles referenced from a ClusterRoleBinding.
    Rules can either apply to API resources (such as 'pods' or 'secrets') or non-resource URL paths (such as '/api'),  but not both.
