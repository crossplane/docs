    "Arguments to the entrypoint.
The docker image's CMD is used if this is not provided.
Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax
can be escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded,
regardless of whether the variable exists or not.
Cannot be updated.
