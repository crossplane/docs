description:
    "ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec.
If specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller implementations for them to use. For example,
in the case of docker, only DockerConfig type secrets are honored.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod
Setting ImagePullSecrets will replace any secrets that have been
propagated to a controller Deployment, typically via packagePullSecrets."
