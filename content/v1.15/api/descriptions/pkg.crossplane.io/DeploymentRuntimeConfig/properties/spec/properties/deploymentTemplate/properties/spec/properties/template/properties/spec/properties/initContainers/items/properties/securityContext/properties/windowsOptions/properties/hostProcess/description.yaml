    "HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container.
All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value
(it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).
In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true."
