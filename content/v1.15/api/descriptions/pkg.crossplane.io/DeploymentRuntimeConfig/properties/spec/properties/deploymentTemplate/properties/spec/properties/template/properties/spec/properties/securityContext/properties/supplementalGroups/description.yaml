description: |-
    A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in addition
    to the container's primary GID, the fsGroup (if specified), and group memberships
    defined in the container image for the uid of the container process. If unspecified,
    no additional groups are added to any container. Note that group memberships
    defined in the container image for the uid of the container process are still effective,
    even if they are not included in this list.
    Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
