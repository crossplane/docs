    An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
    user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
    scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
    removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
    Pod to exceed its resource allocation.
    
    
    To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
    Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.
