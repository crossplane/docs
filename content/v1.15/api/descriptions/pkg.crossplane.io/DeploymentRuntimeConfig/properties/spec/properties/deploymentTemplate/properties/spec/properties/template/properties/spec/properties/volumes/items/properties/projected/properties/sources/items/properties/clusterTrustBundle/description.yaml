    "ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field
of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.


Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.


ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
combination of signer name and a label selector.


Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
may change the order over time."
