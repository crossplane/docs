    NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating
    pod topology spread skew. Options are:
    - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod
    has a toleration, are included.
    - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.
    
    
    If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.
    This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
