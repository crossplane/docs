description:
    "The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update.
Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
Defaults to 25%.
Example: when this is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired pods
immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet
can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring
that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at
least 70% of desired pods."
