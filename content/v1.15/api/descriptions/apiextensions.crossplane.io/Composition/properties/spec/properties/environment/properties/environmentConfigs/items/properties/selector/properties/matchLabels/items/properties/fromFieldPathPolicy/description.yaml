    "FromFieldPathPolicy specifies the policy for the valueFromFieldPath.
The default is Required, meaning that an error will be returned if the
field is not found in the composite resource.
Optional means that if the field is not found in the composite resource,
that label pair will just be skipped. N.B. other specified label
matchers will still be used to retrieve the desired
environment config, if any."
