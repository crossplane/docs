    WriteConnectionSecretsToNamespace specifies the namespace in which the
    connection secrets of composite resource dynamically provisioned using
    this composition will be created.
    This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
    PublishConnectionDetailsWithStoreConfigRef. Currently, both could be
    set independently and connection details would be published to both
    without affecting each other as long as related fields at MR level
    specified.
