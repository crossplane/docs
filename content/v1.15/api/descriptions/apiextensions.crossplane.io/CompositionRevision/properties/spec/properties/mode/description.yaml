    "Mode controls what type or 'mode' of Composition will be used.


'Resources' (the default) indicates that a Composition uses what is
commonly referred to as 'Patch & Transform' or P&T composition. This mode
of Composition uses an array of resources, each a template for a composed
resource.


'Pipeline' indicates that a Composition specifies a pipeline
of Composition Functions, each of which is responsible for producing
composed resources that Crossplane should create or update. THE PIPELINE
MODE IS A BETA FEATURE. It is not honored if the relevant Crossplane
feature flag is disabled."
