    "Referenceable specifies that this version may be referenced by a
Composition in order to configure which resources an XR may be composed
of. Exactly one version must be marked as referenceable; all Compositions
must target only the referenceable version. The referenceable version
must be served. It's mapped to the CRD's `spec.versions[*].storage` field."
