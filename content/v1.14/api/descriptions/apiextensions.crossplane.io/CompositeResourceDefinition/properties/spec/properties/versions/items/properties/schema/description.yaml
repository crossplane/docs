description:
    Schema describes the schema used for validation, pruning, and defaulting of this version of the defined composite resource. Fields required by all composite resources will be injected into this schema automatically, and will override equivalently named fields in this schema. Omitting this schema results in a schema that contains only the fields required by all composite resources.
