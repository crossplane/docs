description:
    ClaimNames specifies the names of an optional composite resource claim. When claim names are specified Crossplane will create a namespaced 'composite resource claim' CRD that corresponds to the defined composite resource. This composite resource claim acts as a namespaced proxy for the composite resource; creating, updating, or deleting the claim will create, update, or delete a corresponding composite resource. You may add claim names to an existing CompositeResourceDefinition, but they cannot be changed or removed once they have been set.
