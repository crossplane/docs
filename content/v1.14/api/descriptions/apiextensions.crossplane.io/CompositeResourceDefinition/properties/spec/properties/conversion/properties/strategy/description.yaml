    "strategy specifies how custom resources are converted between versions. Allowed values are: - `'None'`: The converter only change the apiVersion and would not touch any other field in the custom resource. - `'Webhook'`: API Server will call to an external webhook to do the conversion. Additional information is needed for this option. This requires spec.preserveUnknownFields to be false, and spec.conversion.webhook to be set."
