description:
    A Name uniquely identifies this entry within its Composition's resources array. Names are optional but *strongly* recommended. When all entries in the resources array are named entries may added, deleted, and reordered as long as their names do not change. When entries are not named the length and order of the resources array should be treated as immutable. Either all or no entries must be named.
