    "Type specifies how the pattern matches the input. 
 * `literal` - the pattern value has to exactly match (case sensitive) the input string. This is the default. 
 * `regexp` - the pattern treated as a regular expression against which the input string is tested. Crossplane will throw an error if the key is not a valid regexp."
