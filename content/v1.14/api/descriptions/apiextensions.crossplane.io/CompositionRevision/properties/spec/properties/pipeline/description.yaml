    "Pipeline is a list of composition function steps that will be used when a composite resource referring to this composition is created. One of resources and pipeline must be specified - you cannot specify both. 
 The Pipeline is only used by the 'Pipeline' mode of Composition. It is ignored by other modes. 
 THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is not honored if the relevant Crossplane feature flag is disabled."
