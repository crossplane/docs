    Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. This will only affect labels on the pod, not the pod selector. Labels will be merged with internal labels used by crossplane, and labels with a crossplane.io key might be overwritten. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
