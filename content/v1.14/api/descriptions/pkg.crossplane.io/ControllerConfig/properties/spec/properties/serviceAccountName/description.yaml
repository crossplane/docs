    "ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run this pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/ If specified, a ServiceAccount named this ServiceAccountName will be used for the spec.serviceAccountName field in Pods to be created and for the subjects.name field in a ClusterRoleBinding to be created. If there is no ServiceAccount named this ServiceAccountName, a new ServiceAccount will be created. If there is a pre-existing ServiceAccount named this ServiceAccountName, the ServiceAccount will be used. The annotations in the ControllerConfig will be copied to the ServiceAccount and pre-existing annotations will be kept. Regardless of whether there is a ServiceAccount created by Crossplane or is in place already, the ServiceAccount will be deleted once the Provider and ControllerConfig are deleted."
