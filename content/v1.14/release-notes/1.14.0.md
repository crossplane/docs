### üö® Warnings and breaking changes

* Crossplane Helm images have moved from `index.docker.io` to `xpkg.upbound.io`

  manually update their TLS certificates. Read [Crossplane issue #4565](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/pull/4656) for more information.

  suggests using the [ESS Plugins] as a replacement.

### üí° New features

What's new in v1.14.0

#### Crossplane CLI

Crossplane v1.14 introduces a rebuilt [Crossplane CLI]({{<ref "../cli" >}}). 

The Crossplane CLI provides features to help troubleshoot Crossplane resources,
build and publish Crossplane packages and locally test composition functions.

Read the [CLI documentation]({{<ref "../cli" >}}) for information on installing 
and the full set of
supported features. 

#### Real time Compositions

This release adds the alpha feature "real time compositions" to Crossplane. 

Real time compositions allow Kubernetes to immediately notify Crossplane of
changes to composed resources. Crossplane doesn't need to poll resources to
determine their state. 

Real time compositions dramatically speed up the time Crossplane reacts to
changes or failures of managed resources.

Real time compositions are an alpha feature and isn't enabled by default.

The [Crossplane pods]({{<ref "../concepts/pods#enable-real-time-compositions">}}) 
documentation has more information about real time compositions. 

#### Ordered resource deletion

Crossplane introduces a new `usages` type to prevent resources from
deletion or to ensure deletion happens in the correct order. 

Usages defines a dependency mapping between a resource and any dependencies.
Crossplane can't delete the parent resource until after deleting the child 
resource.

Usages also allow Crossplane to prevent accidental deletion of a resource.

Usages are an alpha feature and aren't enabled by default.

The [Usages]({{<ref "../concepts/usages">}}) documentation provides information
on enabling and configuring Usages.

### üèóÔ∏è Notable changes

v1.14 promotes composition functions to `v1beta1` with 

#### Management policies enabled by default

default.

Composites, Configurations, Functions and Provider objects.
