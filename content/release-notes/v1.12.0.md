## New Features
* ObserveOnly Resources alpha feature introduced by @turkenh . With supporting providers, you are now able to set Crossplane to behave in a read-only mode for a particular resource using the new managementPolicy field.
* With the new Composition Validation alpha feature by @phisco (and some help from @lsviben) introduced initially in #3921 users are now able to early-validate their Compositions and find errors before runtime.
* Pluggable Secret Stores by @ezgidemirel that enables the development and consumption of out-of-tree secret store plugins. This will allow building/using new secret stores for Crossplane without making any changes in Crossplane and/or Provider codebases.

## Notable Updates
* CompositionRevisions have been promoted to v1, with no schema or functional changes that would impact adopters #3715
* With the Pluggable Secret Stores update by @ezgidemirel and @turkenh, the External Secret Stores alpha feature is changing from using the now deprecated in-tree Vault secret store to using pluggable secret stores.
* Added defaultCompositeDeletePolicy and defaultCompositionUpdatePolicy attributes to the XRD to enable the author to specify defaults for how the Composite should be deleted and how Compositions should be updated by @bobh66 in #3963
* Fixing RBAC for clusters which use OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement by @el-mail in #3444
* It is now possible configure XRD's to specify the conversion strategy of their resulting CRD, allowing users to define multiple versions with different schemas #2608
* Support was added for supplying additional volumes and volume mounts for Crossplane through its Helm chart #3830
