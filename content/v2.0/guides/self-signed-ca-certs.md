When Crossplane loads Configuration and Provider Packages from private 
registries, you must configure it to trust the CA and Intermediate certs. 

You need to install Crossplane via the Helm chart with the 
`registryCaBundleConfig.name` and `registryCaBundleConfig.key` parameters 
defined. See [Install Crossplane]({{<ref "../get-started/install" >}}).

## Configure

1. Create a CA Bundle (A file containing your Root and Intermediate 
certificates in a specific order). You can do this with any text editor or 
from the command line, so long as the resulting file contains all required crt 
files in the proper order. Often, this is either a single 
self-signed Root CA crt file, or an Intermediate crt and Root crt file. The 
order of the crt files should be from lowest to highest in signing order. 
For example, if you have a chain of two certificates below your Root 
certificate, you place the bottom level Intermediate cert at the beginning of 
the file, then the Intermediate cert that singed that cert, then the Root cert 
that signed that cert.

2. Save the files as `[yourdomain].ca-bundle`.

3. Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap in your Crossplane system namespace:

```
kubectl -n [Crossplane system namespace] create cm ca-bundle-config \
--from-file=ca-bundle=./[yourdomain].ca-bundle
```

4. Set the `registryCaBundleConfig.name` Helm chart parameter to 
`ca-bundle-config` and the `registryCaBundleConfig.key` parameter to 
`ca-bundle`.

> The Helm docs cover providing Helm with parameter values, 
[Helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/). An example block  
in an `override.yaml` file would look like this:
```
  registryCaBundleConfig:
    name: ca-bundle-config
    key: ca-bundle
```
