The official Crossplane documentation style guide is still under construction.
Guiding principals for the documentation include:
<!-- vale off -->
* Avoid [passive voice](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/passive-voice/).
* Use [sentence-case headings](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/sentence-case).
* Wrap lines at 80 characters.
* Use [present tense](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/simple-present/).
* Spell out numbers less than 10, except for percentages, time and versions.
* Capitalize "Crossplane" and "Kubernetes." 
* Spell out the first use of an acronym unless it's common to new Crossplane
  users. When in doubt, spell it out first. 
* Don't use [cliches](https://www.topcreativewritingcourses.com/blog/common-cliches-in-writing-and-how-to-avoid-them).
* Use contractions for phrases like "do not", "cannot", "is not" and related terms.
* Don't use Latin terms (i.e., e.g., etc.).
* Avoid [gerund](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/gerunds_participles_and_infinitives/index.html) headings (-ing words).
* Try and limit sentences to 25 words or fewer.
* [Be descriptive in link text](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/links#link-text). Don't use "click here" or "read more".

Crossplane documentation is adopting
[Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) and relies on the [Upbound Vale
definitions](https://github.com/upbound/vale) for style guidelines.

Beyond Vale, Crossplane recommends [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and [Hemingway
Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to improve writing quality.

The Crossplane maintainers recommend the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) 
to help answer questions on proper styling.
