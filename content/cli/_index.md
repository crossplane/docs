The Crossplane CLI helps simplify some development and administration aspects of
Crossplane.

The Crossplane CLI includes:
* tools to build, install, update and push Crossplane Packages
* standalone Composition Function testing and rendering without the need to access a Kubernetes cluster running Crossplane
* visual dependency mapping across Compositions, Composite Resources and Managed Resources
